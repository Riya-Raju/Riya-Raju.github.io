Namaskaram üññ. I am Actuarial Analyst working on [Solvency 2](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/browse/regulation-and-policy/solvency-ii_en) regulatory framework and [IFRS 17](https://www.ifrs.org/issued-standards/list-of-standards/ifrs-17-insurance-contracts/) financial reporting standard more specifically in General Insurance Industry.

I intend to leverage my professional educational background and growing actuarial knowledge to translate complex regulatory requirements into strategic and data-driven solutions. Hit me up for professional queries and/or possible collaborations. 

This space is intended to act as my portfolio and grow with me in the coming years. Stay tuned and happy learning! ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
